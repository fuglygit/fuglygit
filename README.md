- 👋 Hi, I’m @fuglygit
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code. I am an experienced electrician and I am interested in
communication between devices (microcontrollers etc) and controlling outputs and inputs. I am also 
interested in the networking needed to communicate between devices on different networks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C++, Node-red, Javascript, Linux, and Bash
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any related projects to allow me to view how other people implement
things and to practice my own coding skills
